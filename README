aimed at numerical simulation (fluid flows, mhd, ...) in spherical geometries.

FEATURES:

	- blazingly fast
	- both scalar and vector transforms
	- backward and forward (synthesis and analysis) functions
	- flexible truncation (degree, order, azimuthal periodicity)
	- spatial data can be stored in latitude-major or longitude-major arrays.
	- various conventions (normalization and Condon-Shortley phase)
	- can be used from Fortran, c/c++, and Python programs
	- a highly efficient Gauss algorithm working with Gauss nodes (based on
	  Gauss-Legendre quadrature)
	- support for SSE2, SSE3 and AVX vectorization with gcc.
	- parallel transforms with OpenMP (for Gauss grid only).
	- an algorithm using DCT for regular nodes (generalized Fejer quadrature)
	- synthesis (inverse transform) at any coordinate (not constrained to a grid)
	- ability to choose the optimal spatial sizes for a given spectral truncation.
	- on-the-fly transforms : saving memory and bandwidth, and can even
	  be faster depending on architecture.
	- accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=8000 (at least).
	- rotation functions to rotate spherical harmonics (beta).
	- special spectral operator functions that do not require a transform
	  (multiply by cos(theta)...).

INSTALL:

	Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
	configure, build, and install this package. `./configure --help' will
	list available options (among which --enable-openmp and --enable-python).
	However, in order to get the best performance, it is highly recommended to
	compile and install the FFTW library yourself, because many distributions
	include a non-optimized FFTW library.

CHANGE LOG:

  v2.3.1  (10 Apr 2013)
	- OpenMP library is now installed as libshtns_omp.a.
	- fix detection of OpenMP mutlithreaded FFTW.
	- new configure option --enable-mkl to use the FFT of the MKL
	  library instead of FFTW.
	- time_SHT can be compiled on MacOSX and uses less memory.
	- new SH_to_lat() function.
	- a few other minor improvements and fixes.

  v2.3  (3 Oct 2012)
	- added mi member in shtns_info structure (ABI change).
	- added function to access the Gauss nodes.
	- added support for special operators in spectral space (multiplication
	  by cos(theta) and sin(theta).d/dtheta for instance).
	- shtns.h is now compatible with C++.
	- better python interface for rotations.
	- performance improvement for OpenMP code without fftw3_omp.
	- slightly faster SH_to_point() [5%] and SHqst_to_point() [20%].
	- bugfix: in some rare cases, OpenMP code freed unallocated memory.
	- bugfix: fixed python interface compilation with clang.

  v2.2.4  (25 Jun 2012)
	- the previous critical bugfix had not been applied to parallel OpenMP
	  transforms.

  v2.2.3  (24 Jun 2012)
	- critical bugfix: SHtor_to_spat() and SHsph_to_spat() gave wrong results
	  for mmax>0 with on-the-fly transoforms.
	- minor bugfix in Python interface.

  v2.2.2  (21 Jun 2012)
	- better Python interface: using synth() and analys() methods.
	- bugfix in build system: can now compile python extension without openmp.

  v2.2.1  (21 May 2012)
	- slightly faster parallel transforms.
	- better Python interface: decent error handling and keyword argument support.
	- changes to Python interface: grid defaults to SHT_PHI_CONTIGUOUS, 
	  set_grid_auto() removed.
	- bugfix: default compilation with FFTW 3.0 to avoid "bad Gauss points" error.
	- bugfix: correct alignement of gauss weights in 32 bit systems to avoid
	  segfaults.
	- new ./configure script for easier configuration and compilation.

  v2.2  (23 Apr 2012)
	- parallel transforms with OpenMP (for Gauss grid, significant benefit
	  for l>=127).

  v2.1  (8 Mar 2012)
	- support for huge spherical harmonic degree (tested up to l>43600).
	- speed improvements, especially for large transforms.
	- compilation with FFTW v3.0 or more is now possible through a 
	  configuration option (see sht_config.h)

  v2.0  (9 Feb 2012)
	- support for AVX instruction set (almost x2 speed-up on Sandy-Bridge
	  processors).
	- allow multiple transforms with different sizes, normalizations and
	  grids (C interface only).
	- changes to C interface : most functions now require a handle to identify
	  the transform. (Fortran interface unchanged)
	- transforms are accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=2700 (at least).
	- lots of small improvements, speed-ups and a few bug fixes.
	- requires FFTW v3.3.
	- better Python interface using NumPy arrays (beta).
	- rotation functions to rotate spherical harmonics (beta).

  v1.5  (4 May 2011)
	- on-the-fly transforms which do not require huge matrices : save memory
	  and bandwidth, and can be faster on some architecture.
	- runtime selection of fastest algorithm, including on-the-fly transforms.
	- transforms are accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=2045 (at least).
	- fix a bug that lead to wrong results for SHtor_to_spat and SHsph_to_spat.
	- a bunch of minor improvements, optimizations and fixes.

  v1.0  (9 June 2010)
	- initial release for C/C++ and Fortran under CeCILL licence (GPL compatible).
	- scalar and vector, forward and backward transforms.
	- support several normalization conventions.
	- transforms are accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=1300 (at least).

	- SSE2 vectorization.
	- synthesis at any coordinate (not constrained to grid).
	- can choose the optimal spatial size for a given spectral truncation.
	- requires FFTW 3.0.
