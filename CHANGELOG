SHTns is a library for Spherical Harmonic Transform written in C, aimed at
	numerical simulation (fluid flows, mhd, ...) in spherical geometries.

v2.0  (? August 2011)
	- allow multiple transforms with different sizes, normalizations and grids (C interfcace only).
	- changes to C interface : most functions now require a handle to identify the transform. (Fortran interface unchanged)
	- transforms are accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=2700 (at least).
	- lots of small improvements, speedups and a few bugfixes.
	- requires FFTW v3.3.

v1.5  (4 May 2011)
	- on-the-fly transforms which do not require huge matrices : save memory and bandwidth,
	  and can be faster on some architecture.
	- runtime selection of fastest algorithm, including on-the-fly transforms.
	- transforms are accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=2045 (at least).
	- fix a bug that lead to wrong results for SHtor_to_spat() and SHsph_to_spat().
	- a bunch of minor improvements, optimizations and fixes.

v1.0  (9 June 2010)
	- initial release for C/C++ and Fortran under CeCILL licence (GPL compatible).
	- scalar and vector, forward and backward transforms.
	- support several normalization conventions.
	- transforms are accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=1300 (at least).
	- flexible truncation ans spatial sizes.
	- support spatial data stored in latitude-major or longitude-major arrays.
	- regular grid (with DCT acceleration) or Gauss grid (highly optimized).
	- SSE2 vectorization.
	- synthesis at any coordinate (not constrained to grid).
	- can choose the optimal spatial size for a given spherical harmonic truncation.
	- requires FFTW 3.0.
