*** BUG ***
+ NPHI>MMAX*2 is right condition for the sampling theorem to apply.	(16/10/2008)
+ Bug found in SHT.c : here are the correct versions of LiM() and LM marcros :	(16/10/2008)
	#define LiM(l,im) ( (im*(2*LMAX+2 -MRES*(im+1)))/2 + l )
	#define LM(l,m) ( (m*(2*LMAX+2 -(m+MRES)))/(2*MRES) + l )
+ Bug found in SHT.c : LMAX odd was treated incorrectly. (25/10/2008)

*** TODO ***
Compare speed with spherepack.
Split init routines and transform routines + combine them in a lib.
Import legendre function from gsl, as they can be made more precise (long double)
	and/or faster (by storing precomputations). Also direct evaluation at specified x
	could be made directly.

*** Optimizations ***

for m=0, z[k] is zero up to l-1
         dtz[k] is zero up to l-2
for m=1, z[k] is zero up to l-2
         dtz[k] is constant up to l-1
for m=2, z[k] is constant up to l-1
         dtz[k] is constant up to l-2
for m=3, z[k] is constant up to l-2

- Optimize m=0 and NPHI=1 (don't need to go to "complex" representation)
- Using CUDA may be interesting !

+ cache optimization have been performed for m=0 and are quite impressive at high LMAX.

TIP:
+ LM_LOOP : translating an integer to a double is SLOW. So if l or l(l+1) is used in the computation, using an array is faster.
     furthermore, it seems that cache misses has less penalty than branch misses.
     LM loop with li[lm] array access seems faster... (at least for 4 arrays access).

TIP:
+ other optimization : NLAT and NPHI should be checked for fftw-friendliness.

*** SHT.c

+ CHECK for accuracy with MTR_DCT, default to gauss if not good enough.
- Implement l even/odd sub-transforms.
- Implement sperate m sub-transforms.

- SHT e/o does not work in DCT space. (ok in Gauss version as of r72)

for SHsphtor_to_spat, maybe storing .t and .p together is not the best... => I think it is.

- SHT : implement even and odd l sub-cases.
	should not change array sizes. only SHT function calls may (must) be different.
-!!!	grid.c should also treat even/odd sub-cases. !!!

- FFTW : out-of-place is faster than in-place. switch ? http://www.fftw.org/speed/CoreDuo-3.0GHz-icc64/
- try blas ?

- SHT : NLAT odd could be improved a little bit.

+ NLAT odd is now allowed
	special treatment in SHT function. (but could be improved : point NLAT_2 has only even component)


*** NOTES :
DCT SHT is ok for LMAX=1300 and NLAT_2=1024. changeset 70:f901295a7862

Run-time setup for everything.
DCT is about 25% faster than GAUSS for xshells dj_ref case (axisym).
