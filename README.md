FEATURES:
---------

- **blazingly fast**.
- both **scalar and vector transforms**.
- backward and forward (synthesis and analysis) functions.
- flexible truncation (degree, order, azimuthal periodicity).
- spatial data can be stored in latitude-major or longitude-major arrays.
- various conventions (normalization and Condon-Shortley phase).
- can be used from **Fortran, c/c++, Python, and Java** programs.
- highly efficient Gauss algorithm working with Gauss nodes (based on
  Gauss-Legendre quadrature).
- support for **regular grids** (but they require twice the number of nodes than Gauss grid)
- support for SSE2, SSE3, **AVX, AVX2, AVX-512** vectorization, as well as 
  Xeon Phi (KNL) and AltiVec VSX.
- **parallel transforms with OpenMP**.
- *Beta*: automatic **GPU off-loading** with nvidia cuda (Kepler, Pascal & Volta).
- synthesis (inverse transform) at any coordinate (not constrained to a grid).
- **on-the-fly transforms** : saving memory and bandwidth, they are even faster
  on modern architectures.
- accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=16383 (at least).
- **rotation** functions to rotate spherical harmonics.
- special spectral operator functions that do not require a transform
  (multiply by cos(theta)...).
- transforms and rotations for complex-valued spatial fields.
- SHT at fixed m (without fft, aka Legendre transform - beta).


INSTALL:
--------

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install` should
configure, build, and install this package. `./configure --help` will
list available options (among which `--enable-openmp` and `--enable-python`).
However, in order to get the best performance, it is highly recommended to
compile and install the FFTW library yourself, because many distributions
include a non-optimized FFTW library.
